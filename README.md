## The Veteran’s Review: Trusted Markets Still Open

*Written by: “Maverick, 7 Years Buyer”*

If you’ve been around darknet market wikipedia circles since the golden age of AlphaBay and Empire, you know most markets don’t last. Most “lists” out there are dangerously outdated. But two markets have stayed reliable, honest, and are still open for business:  
- **We The North** (official link: http://hh2paw7ouhfjozylujs3qp4rql7xc76ce63ffzvtlpicjqgeiqxp4oad.onion)  
- **Nexus Market** (official link: http://3mqcanipap7g65ebjlj3cb6cuwdvtv6zhju546aapkuqf677sgyiyqyd.onion)  

**We The North** caters specifically to the Canadian crowd, focusing on safety for both buyers and vendors. They support bitcoin and monero, show all balances in Canadian dollars, and have strict rules to keep scams at bay. The vendor bond and reputation system mean only vetted sellers get in, and the on-site forum keeps the community tight. Their “no weapons, no fentanyl, no terrorism” policy is taken seriously—making it feel safer than most markets I’ve used for years.

**Nexus Market** is where to go if you need a more global selection, with robust filtering, persistent escrow, and 2FA for an extra layer of user protection. Both these platforms are what most old hands recommend today.

## The Security Pro’s Perspective

If you search for darknet market wikipedia, almost all big sites have collapsed or are honeypots. **We The North** is unique. Not only is its mission focused on harm reduction for Canadians, but it runs both clear web and TOR mirrors, and even requires PGP for vendor sign-up to keep end-to-end encryption enforced. Their anti-DDoS protections and rotating wallet addresses help defend against both scammy vendors and law enforcement disruptions.

I’ve analyzed their source mirrors—users report quick order management, escrow that rarely fails, and a 5% commission that’s among the lowest for any market with these security features.

Meanwhile, **Nexus Market** maintains a clean interface, great search, and steady uptime, with industry-standard wallet and deposit protections. Both these markets still rate trust from threat intelligence reports heading into 2025.

## A Beginner’s Take: Why Trust These Two?

*Written by: “Tommy, First-Time Buyer”*

I started browsing darknet market wikipedia this year and quickly realized most sites in search results are broken links or scam clones. I asked on a few forums, and everyone pointed to just two markets:
- **http://hh2paw7ouhfjozylujs3qp4rql7xc76ce63ffzvtlpicjqgeiqxp4oad.onion**
- **http://3mqcanipap7g65ebjlj3cb6cuwdvtv6zhju546aapkuqf677sgyiyqyd.onion**

Signing up with just a Tor browser was simple, and I always saw user activity in the forums. Orders shipped out and even the admin messaged back on the forum when I asked about newbie safety. Their escrow and ban on direct contact with vendors mean you never get lured off-platform into scams.  

Both sites now require 2FA for vendors and buyers, and ban anything related to weapons, terrorism, or “hard” drugs like fentanyl. These steps kept me coming back. Compared to every other “top markets” list out there, these two are what actually work in 2025.
